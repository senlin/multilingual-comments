WordPress plugin that combines comments from all translations of the posts and pages using WPML.

## Description

This plugin combines comments from all translations of the posts and pages using WPML. Comments are internally still attached to the post or page in the language they were made on.
Naturally the WPML plugin is required to run.

This is a fixed version of the no longer maintained WPML Comment Merging plugin:
https://wordpress.or/plugins/wpml-comment-merging/ and https://github.com/JulioPotier/wpml-comments-merging

There are no Settings, it simply does what it says on the label.

This plugin was developed with the assistance of ChatGPT, an AI language model created by [OpenAI](https://www.openai.com/).

If you are looking to show comments in all languages on your website with WPML installed, I highly recommend installing the Multilingual Comments WPML plugin. 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are the Settings?

Yes, the plugin transforms Simplified Chinese slugs into pinyin.

### Does Pinyin Slugs work with Traditional Chinese characters?

You can stop looking, there are no settings. This plugin works out of the box.

### Why is the plugin showing an error message after activation?

This plugin is an Addon for [WPML](https://wpml.org), the plugin that enables any WordPress website to become 100% multilingual. If you do not have WPML installed, this plugin is useless, so better not install it.

### I have an issue with this plugin, where can I get support?
